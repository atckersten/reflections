When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you are in a project with multiple developers that have to work on the same code base.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pull manually because you want to see the changes and determine if these are acceptable and do not break your code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a copy of a repository on github. It can be used to share code without letting the commits on the fork impact your code base.
A clone is a copy of a repository either from github to your local machine or from one location on your local machine to another location on your local machine. 
A branche is a specific series of commits that are related to each other.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It makes it possible to check if your codes has any merging conflicts with the remote origin/master.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    harder: mailing changed code with comments, talk to codevelopers, not working on the same parts simultaneously. easier: work on your own piece of code.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
