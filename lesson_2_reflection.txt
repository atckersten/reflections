What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? The directory is under GIT version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers? Staging area collects files that are ready to be submitted to the Git repository. The staging area makes it possible to manage your commits in logically separated pieces.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change? Once committed a file to the staging area make sure you commit one commit per logical change to the repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help? A branch is helpful in case you want to experiment with part of new or changed code leaving the main codebase untouched. It is easy to get back to your original code by reverting back to a particular (piece of) a certain branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure? It makes clear what commits are submitted at a particular moment and shows what changes have been made on a particular branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do? It results the changes that were made in different branches to be consolidated into one branch. Representation is nog clear to me.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually? Auto merging save al lot of time and makes sure that changes that are clearly correct are committed. Auto merging also points out code that needs to be discussed (not clear what is correct) between multiple contributors.
